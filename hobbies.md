<br>The F1 race is not just about the driver’s efforts, but the team’s efforts are more important. This is a cooperation and game between drivers and decision-making groups, and a game between teams. The performance of the car can determine the ranking in the qualifying race, but it cannot represent the position on the podium. It is almost impossible to complete every race smoothly even with the extreme development of driving skills and car performance. In difficult weather or track conditions, drivers do not know what kind of situation they will face. Some choose to go forward bravely, like James Hunt finishing Japanese Grand Prix in 1976 ，while others choose to be cautious. Racing is very similar to personal development. Some people can drive the car of Red Bull or Ferrari as soon as they enter the track, but Red Bull drivers cannot win every podium, just as Perez won his first podium in 2020 while driving for Racing Point.This is the most interesting part of this competition. Personal efforts, team decisions, car performance, track conditions, and other factors will affect the results of the race. No one can tell who will be the winner of this race. Everyone will do their best to enjoy every race and every moment of speed and passion.

## Other Hobbies

I previously enjoyed jogging,painting，baking， [video making](https://space.bilibili.com/66708724), and watching documentaries. However, I have no time to do these things recently.
I also love hanging out with my friends. Sometimes we go to restaurants to enjoy delicious food, or we just take a short trip. I think this is a great way to relax by spending time with my good friends and enjoying a pleasant dinner or vacation together.
